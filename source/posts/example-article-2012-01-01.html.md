Included within the context of zanshin is a separate move called yudaosbi, the
lowering of the bow. In yudaosbi maintain visual contact with the target as you
slowly lower your hands to your sides, so that the end of the bow is once again
in line with the center of the body. Next, turn your head to face the kamiza.
After that, step with the right foot in a half-step toward the center of the
body, then bring the left foot over to meet the right, thus bringing the basic
shooting procedure to a close.

## Ashibumi

To make a smooth ashibumi, never shift your body or bend your legs when
stepping. It is often helpful to think of spreading your feet as you would
unfold a fan.

If ashibumi is wider than normal, the body will be stable from the sides but
far too weak from the front and back. Also, the arrow may fly high. Conversely,
if the footing is too narrow, the body will be stable from the front and back
but will have a tendency to lean to the left or right. Also, the arrow may fly
too low.

Keep these four points in mind when making tenouchi:

* Keep the wrist perfectly straight.
* Have the feeling of pushing the thumb forward along the top of the middle
  finger.
* Keep the bow pressed against the hand by working the last three fingers as if
  they were one.
* Hold the bow so that when the string is not under tension it is about five
  centimeters away from the forearm.

## Intermediate Technique and Instruction

To stand correctly, think of gently stretching the neck and spine so that your
body is naturally straight.  Stand like a crane, not like a turtle. Here are
five points to keep in mind when making dozukuri:

1. Gently stretch the neck and spine.
2. Keep the small of the back tucked in.
3. Have a feeling of lifting up the buttocks.
4. Take up the slack in the upper and lower legs.
5. Lightly lock the knees.

### Torikake

To make torikake, think of rotating your whole arm.  Do this with a feeling of
pushing from under the elbow. This movement will transfer to the hand so that
the thumb pushes up and outward, and the forefinger rotates to hold the arrow
in place.

### Habiki

After completing the tenouchi and torikake, gently spread your back and
shoulders to take up the slack in your arms. This action, called the habiki,
will cause the string to be pulled slightly so that the feathers can clear the
bow.

Today, advanced ceremonial shooting is performed by archers of great skill and
experience. Consequently, it lies outside the sphere of practice of most
kyudojo, where daily training tends to center around simple makiwara or target
practice. The standard practice methods presented here, both seated and
standing, are semiformal shooting procedures. These are used not only for daily
practice but for contests and examinations as well. Therefore, when practicing
these procedures you should try to exhibit a high degree of grace and
refinement, just as the masters do when they perform a formal shooting
ceremony.

>Taihai means "form" and correct form is a product of
correct posture and correct movement.

When you visit a Japanese kyudojo, you will hear the instructor refer often to
a student's taibai. Taihai means "form" and correct form is a product of
correct posture and correct movement.

## Seated Practice

To shoot the otoya, kneel once more and repeat steps 11-40. When finished,
slide the right foot a half step forward and to the right to move away from the
shai. Then, beginning with the left foot, leave the shooting area.

## Standing Practice

If one has difficulty kneeling, the shooting procedure may be carried out
entirely from the standing position.
