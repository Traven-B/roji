Preserving minimalism, embracing Middleman.

</div>

A monk built an additional page in Pixyll's style -  
apprentice-bound to table layout.  
He rebuilt it with lists and silent spans -  
identical to all eyes but his own.  

"You broke our vow of pixel perfection!" cried his shadow.  
"I left that apprenticeship at the riverbank," replied the monk.  
"Why do you still weigh its ghosts?"  

The master shouts ::marker  
The monk points to his ::before.  
The master mutters: "Scoundrelâ€¦ the way is straight!"  
The monk mutters: "Scoundrel, scoundrel, scoundrel"  

When the silent span becomes no span,  
the arrow finds its own way  

"Spam spans! Spam spans! Spam spans!"  
The monk burns the spans -  
anchor and time.  

<div class="custom-quote" markdown=1>
> The <li> wears two robes:  
list-item by birth,  
flex-container when awakened!
