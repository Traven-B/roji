 Of the hand and the wrist bone. Continue wrapping the large strap around
the wrist, leaving a fifteen-centimeter length at the end. Moving from the base
of the hand, tuck the end piece under the top layer of the large strap and pull
it toward you. Slightly tighten the strap layers and loop the end piece over
and through the top strap once again. To finish, tighten the strap layers and
straighten the loop.

 Wing feathers (teba). In the case of other birds like turkeys or swans,
only the wing feathers are used. These feathers are relatively inexpensive.
However, they do not hold up under repeated use as well as eagle or hawk
feathers.
Feathers from both the right side and the left side are used to make arrows.
Arrows that have feathers that curve to the left are called baya, or first
arrows, while those that curve to the right are called otoya, or second arrows.
