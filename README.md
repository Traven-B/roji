## About Pixyll

Roji is inspired by the [Pixyll theme](https://www.pixyll.com/) crafted by [John Otander](https://johno.com). Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile-first, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

You can find the Pixyll GitHub repository here: <https://github.com/johno/pixyll>.
